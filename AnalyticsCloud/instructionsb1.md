## SAP HANA Web IDE – Creating / Accessing Calculation Views
### Step 1 – Calculation Views in SAP HANA
### Option 1 – Accessing SAP HANA Web IDE and creating new Calculation Views
* If you intend to build SAP HANA calculation views in order to explore your demo data, you will need to populate SAP B1 tables through Service Layer, and then pull the information from those tables to build the calculation views using the [SAP HANA Web IDE](http://hana_server:8000/sap/hana/ide/editor);
* Follow [these steps](https://github.com/B1SA/hackathon/blob/master/AnalyticsCloud/Modeling_Hackaton.pptx) to create simple calculation views in SAP HANA database for your SAC demonstration.

### Option 2 – Accessing SAP HANA Web IDE and using readymade Calculation Views
* If you intend to access SAP HANA readymade calculation views in order to explore your demo data, you will need to populate SAP B1 tables through Service Layer, and then pull the information from those tables with the readymade calculation views contained in SAP HANA. You can access and visualize them using the [SAP HANA Web IDE](http://hana_server:8000/sap/hana/ide/editor).
